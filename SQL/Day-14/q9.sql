Problem Description:
The operational audit team wants to review veterans working in key corporate locations to schedule long-service awards. 
Write an SQL query to retrieve the employee name, their hire date, their job description, and their department location. 
Filter the records to only display employees who were hired before January 1, 1997, and who are located in 'Dallas' or 'New York'. 
Sort the output so that the longest-serving employee appears first.
