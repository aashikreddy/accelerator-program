Problem Description:
The compensation committee needs to cross-reference employee salaries against standard grade brackets to analyze workforce distribution. 
Write an SQL query to retrieve the employee name, their job title, their exact salary, and the corresponding salary grade from the salgrade table. 
An employee's salary falls into a grade if it is between the low salary (losal) and high salary (hisal) boundaries.
Sort the results from the highest grade to the lowest grade.
