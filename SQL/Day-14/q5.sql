Problem Description:
The HR department needs a clear view of the management reporting hierarchy to update their internal directory. 
Write an SQL query to retrieve the names of all employees alongside the names of their direct managers. 
The output should display the employee's number, employee's name, and the manager's name under the alias manager_name. 
Exclude any employees who do not report to anyone, and sort the list alphabetically by the manager's name.
