Problem Description:
The marketing team wants to identify which food items are completely unpopular or haven't successfully converted into delivered sales yet. 
Write an SQL query to list the names of all food items, their categories, and the total count of times they have been successfully delivered.
Use a left join to ensure that food items with zero delivered orders are still present in the list with a count of 0. Sort the results alphabetically by the food item name.
