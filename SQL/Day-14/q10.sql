Problem Description:
The business development team wants to reward loyal customers who frequently spend money on non-cancelled orders. 
Write an SQL query to find the customer ID, email address, and the total cumulative amount spent across all their orders. 
Exclude any orders that have a status of 'Cancelled' from the aggregation, and only include customers whose total spending exceeds 500. 
Order the final output from highest spending to lowest spending.
