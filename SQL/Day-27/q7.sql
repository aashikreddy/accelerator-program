Problem : 
The delivery logistics team wants to evaluate customer ordering patterns by ranking 
the longest delays between consecutive orders per customer. Calculate the days 
elapsed between each customer's consecutive orders using LAG() and rank these gap 
durations to surface each customer's single longest idle period between orders.
