/*
Problem : 
The corporate governance team wants to determine the reporting distance
(number of management layers) between each employee and top-level executive
management. A recursive CTE must trace the manager chain upwards, 
incrementing a depth counter until reaching the root (mgr IS NULL), 
displaying each employee's ID, name, assigned supervisor, and total management
distance.
