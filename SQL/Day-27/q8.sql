Problem : 
The finance team needs a breakdown showing how much revenue each food item 
contributes relative to its entire menu category. Use windowed aggregation SUM() 
OVER(PARTITION BY category) inside a CTE to compute the total category sales and 
calculate each food item's exact percentage contribution to its category revenue.
