/*
Problem : 
The platform operations center wants to monitor running sales targets. 
They require a query that computes the cumulative running total of all order 
amounts sorted by order date, and flags the exact order record where the overall 
cumulative company revenue first crosses the milestone threshold of ₹2,000.
