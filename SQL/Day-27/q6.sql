Problem : 
The HR rewards team is auditing salary dispersion across departments. 
They want to calculate the numeric gap between the maximum and minimum salary 
within each department, alongside the mid-tier salary using ROW_NUMBER() and COUNT() 
logic within a CTE to identify employees positioned closest to the departmental median.
