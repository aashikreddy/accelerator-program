Problem : 
The growth marketing division wants to identify customers who are accelerating their 
spending over time. For every order placed by a customer, compare their current order 
amount against the average amount of their previous 2 orders using a window frame. 
Filter and output only orders where the current spending exceeds that 2-order prior 
average.
