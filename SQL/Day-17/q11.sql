Problem Description:
The operations team wants a diagnostic view of current processing streams that contrasts active transactions right alongside user historic order volumes.
Write a read-only SQL query to output the order ID, customer ID, order date, status, and total amount. Join the main table against an inline derived subquery 
table that pre-calculates the absolute count of historical orders placed by each unique customer ID.

case=1
output=
order_id	customer_id	order_date	status	total_amount	total_customer_orders
