/*
An enterprise data analyst needs to audit high-performing customer accounts to identify regional market leaders.
Write a read-only SQL query to find the customer ID, their full name (first name and last name combined), their city address, 
and their total lifetime expenditure across all orders.

Filter the results using a complex correlated subquery inside the HAVING clause so that you only return customers whose 
cumulative lifetime spending is strictly greater than the historical average of individual transaction amounts placed by all customers living in that exact same city.
