/*
The internal audit department needs a unified exception report detailing extreme pay scenarios across corporate levels. 
Write a read-only SQL query that extracts the employee name, their supervisor's name, and their salary for employees 
who earn more money than their direct supervisor. Use a UNION ALL block to append another dataset matching high-earner outliers: 
employees whose base salary is strictly greater than the calculated average salary of all active managers combined.
