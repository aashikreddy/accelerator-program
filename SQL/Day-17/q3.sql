Problem Description:
The regional managers require a clean breakdown of the employee payroll to analyze individual salary weights against company baselines. 
Write a read-only SQL query to list each employee's name, their department number, and their exact salary from the emp table. 
Include a dynamically calculated column named company_max_salary using a scalar subquery to display the absolute highest salary alongside every employee row.
