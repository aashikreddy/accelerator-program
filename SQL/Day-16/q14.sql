Problem Description:
The kitchen logistics team wants to identify unusually large transactional orders to optimize packaging and high-volume delivery preparation. 
Write a read-only SQL query to retrieve the order ID, customer ID, order date, food item name, and the recorded total amount for individual transactions. 
Filter the output to return only those orders where the transaction's total_amount is strictly greater than the calculated historical average total amount
spent specifically on that exact food item across the entire platform.
