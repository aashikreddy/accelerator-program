Problem Description:
The restaurant marketing team wants to send a promotional thank-you email to customers who have placed individual high-value orders.
Write an SQL query to retrieve the customer's full name (first name and last name combined), their email address, the order ID,
and the specific order's total amount. Use an uncorrelated subquery in the filtering clause to restrict the output to orders whose total_amount 
is strictly greater than the overall average total amount computed across all orders in the system.
