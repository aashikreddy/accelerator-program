Problem Description:
The executive committee needs an audit report containing the details of all employees who are either 
the absolute lowest earner in their respective department, or hold the maximum tenure (earliest hire date) 
across the whole company. Bring these two distinct granular groups together into one dataset matrix 
by joining them using a UNION ALL set operator.
