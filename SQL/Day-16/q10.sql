Problem Description:
The financial data analyst wants to understand the concentration of salary distribution inside each department. 
Write an SQL query to retrieve the employee name, department number, salary, and a calculated inline column called department_contribution_percentage. 
This column must use a correlated scalar subquery to find what percentage the individual's 
salary constitutes out of the total salary pool of their own department.

output=
ename	deptno	sal	department_contribution_percentage
CLARK	10	2450.00	45.79

FORD	10	1300.00	24.30
SCOTT	20	3000.00	25.37
FORD	20	3000.00	25.37
