Problem: Repeat Customer Order Interval Frequency
The customer retention division wants to measure repeat user engagement speed on 
the platform. For every order placed by a customer, determine the previous order 
date from that same user and calculate the exact elapsed time (in hours) between 
consecutive transactions. This metric helps measure user purchase frequency.
