Problem: Sequential Transaction Delta Tracking
The risk management team is analyzing transaction variance across consecutive
platform orders. They need a query displaying each order's total spend alongside
the amount spent in the immediately preceding order. Additionally, calculate the
numeric variance (delta) between current and prior purchases to detect unusual 
shifts.
