Problem : Second-In-Command Department Earners

The executive management team is creating a leadership succession program. 
As part of this initiative, they need to pinpoint the exact employees who hold 
the second-highest salary tier within each respective department. The query must 
properly account for tied top salaries so that true second-tier compensation earners
are retrieved.
