Problem: Food Menu Item Demand Popularity Index

The inventory management team wants to rank menu offerings based on customer 
consumption. They require a breakdown of total item quantities sold across all 
completed orders and want each item ranked by total sales volume. This popularity
 metric will determine which items receive primary placement on the food platform.
