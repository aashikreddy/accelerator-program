Problem: Cumulative Platform Revenue Stream
The finance department needs a real-time ledger tracking cumulative revenue 
performance over time. They want to inspect every transaction in sequential 
order alongside a running aggregate total of overall customer spend. This ledger
provides quick visibility into cash flow growth across the platform.
