Problem: Comprehensive Salary Ranking Method Comparison

A data analytics instructor is preparing a SQL workshop demonstration on window 
ranking behavior. To illustrate how ties are handled differently, the system must 
rank all company employees by salary using ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK 
side-by-side. The goal is to visually demonstrate gap generation versus continuous 
integer ranking when identical salaries occur.
