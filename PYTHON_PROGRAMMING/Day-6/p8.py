Problem Statement:

A university provides merit scholarships to eligible students
based on their academic performance.

The scholarship committee receives applications from multiple
students and processes them during a scholarship evaluation session.

Whenever the evaluation starts, the system should automatically
establish a scholarship evaluation session.

After processing all student applications, the evaluation
session should automatically close irrespective of whether
the evaluation completes successfully or an exception occurs.

Each student application contains:

Student ID
Student Name
CGPA
Annual Family Income

Student information should be stored using a dataclass.

The dataclass should use __slots__ to optimize memory usage.

All student records should be stored in a list.

The scholarship score is calculated as:

Scholarship Score = (CGPA × 10) − (Annual Income / 100000)

Students should be ranked according to the scholarship score
using a lambda expression.

After ranking, eligible students should be generated one by
one using a generator function.

The generated students should then be verified one by one
using an iterator.

Eligibility Criteria:

CGPA >= 8.0

Annual Family Income <= 500000

If CGPA is less than 0 or greater than 10,
raise a custom exception and display:

Invalid CGPA

If Annual Family Income is less than or equal to zero,
display:

Invalid Annual Income

Requirements:

1. Create a dataclass using @dataclass(slots=True).
2. Create a Context Manager using __enter__() and __exit__().
3. Store student details using a list.
4. Rank students using a lambda expression.
5. Generate eligible students using a generator.
6. Verify generated students using an iterator.
7. Create a custom exception.
8. Use raise and try-except.
9. Automatically close the evaluation session.

Input Format:

First line contains the number of students.

Next N sets contain:

Student ID
Student Name
CGPA
Annual Family Income

Output Format:

Opening Scholarship Evaluation Session...

Scholarship Ranking:

S101 -> Ravi -> 9.6 -> 300000
S102 -> Priya -> 9.3 -> 250000
S103 -> Rahul -> 8.9 -> 450000

Eligible Students:

S101 -> Ravi
S102 -> Priya
S103 -> Rahul

Scholarship Evaluation Session Closed

If the number of students is less than or equal to zero,
display:

Invalid Number of Students

If CGPA is invalid, display:

Invalid CGPA

If Annual Family Income is invalid, display:

Invalid Annual Income
